## ❯ Getting Started

+ In this app, I just using react with redux toolkit.
+ Using MUI in styled component.
+ Alias from babel x webpack
+ Multi environment
+ I already implemented auto-handling token service for future improvement
+ Multi Language (just implemented English).

**Note: 
- This is my own architecture. I built it based on my knowledge and experience.
- Since I don't have enough time to implement the project more deeply. So I just wrote sample of happy unit tests for now.
- We can optimize the architecture and performance in the future by implementing the message queue, so that it can be able to process many requests at once, it also easier to scale the project by initializing new consumers.
